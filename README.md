## Security & Middleware

- Helmet: Sets secure HTTP headers, including CSP, HSTS, XSS protection, etc.
- CORS: Allows requests only from the configured frontend domain.
- Rate Limiting: Limits requests to avoid abuse and DoS attacks. 
- Validation & Logging: Custom response templates, input checks, and Winston logs.

## Logging (Winston)

- logs/combined.log: All logs
- logs/error.log: Only error logs
- Every controller event, API call, and error is logged

## File Uploads

- Uses GridFS (MongoDB) for storing images/files.

Built with care and lots of â˜• â€” Happy Coding!
